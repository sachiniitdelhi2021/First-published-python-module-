## All 10 functions of module 

- First function is - add_numbers (for adding any number of numbers)
- Second function is - mul_numbers (for multiplying any number of numbers) 
- Third function is - div_numbers (for performing division of numbers)
- Fourth function is - sub_numbers (for getting subtraction of any two numbers )
- Fifth function is - simple_int (for calculating simple interest)
- Sixth function is - compound_int (for calculating compound interest)
- Seventh function is - get_log (for getting the log of any given positive number to any base )
- Eight function is - exp_power (This function is used for getting the value of exponent for any power)
- Ninth function is - Roots_quad (This function is used for getting the real roots of quadratic equation.
    (a*x^2+b*x+c) where a, b and c are the constants.)
- Tenth function is - num_power (This function is used for getting the value of any power of any number.)
## Usage

- Make sure you have Python installed in your system.
- Run Following command in the CMD.
 ```
  pip install maths_ops
  ```
## Example

 ```
# for first function of the module 
from maths_ops import add_numbes

add_numbers(1,2,3,4,5)   #you can give any number of numbers 
here we are giving 5 numbers 

result---> 15 

#for fifth function 
simple_int(P,R,T)
# P- 10000 this is principle amount  
# R - 5 this is rate 
# T- 5 this is time 

result---> 2500

#similarly we can use remainig functions also  
  ```


## Note 
- I have tried to implement all the functionality, it might have some bugs also. Ignore that or please try to solve that bug.
